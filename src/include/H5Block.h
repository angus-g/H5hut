  \note
  Different field sizes are allowed in the same time-step.

  \note
  The same layout can be used, if the size of the field matches the
  size of the layout.  If the size of the layout doesn't match the
  size of the field, an error will be indicated. 
 
  \note
  In write mode partitions are shrinked to make them non-overlaping. This 
  process may shrink the partitions more than required.

  \note
  In read-mode partitions may not cross boundaries. This means, if the grid
  size is (X, Y, Z), all partitions must fit into this grid.

  \todo
  check whether layout is reasonable
