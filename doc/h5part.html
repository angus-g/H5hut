Particle based simulations of accelerator beam-lines, especially in
six dimensional phase space, generate vast amounts of data. Even
though a subset of statistical information regarding phase space
or analysis needs to be preserved, reading and writing such
enormous restart files on massively parallel supercomputing
systems remains challenging.<p>

<P>
H5Part is a very simple data storage schema and provides an
API that simplifies the reading/writing of the data to the HDF5
file format. An important foundation for a stable visualization and data
analysis environment is a stable and portable file storage format and
its associated APIs. The presence of a "common file storage format,"
including associated APIs, will help foster a fundamental level of
interoperability across the project's software infrastructure. It will
also help ensure that key data analysis capabilities are present
during the earliest phases of the software development effort.
</P>
<P>
H5Part is built on top of the <a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5">HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format).</a>
HDF5 offers a self-describing machine-independent
binary file format that supports scalable parallel I/O
performance for MPI codes on a variety of supercomputing
systems, and works equally well on laptop computers. The API is
available for C, C++, and Fortran codes. The H5Part file format and APIs
enable disparate research groups with different simulation
implementations to transparently share datasets and data
analysis tools. For instance, the common file format will enable
groups that depend on completely different simulation
implementations to share data analysis tools.

<font face="arial,helvetica" color="#555588"><h2>H5Part file organization and API</h2></font>
<P>
The proposed file storage format uses HDF5 for the lowlevel
file storage and a simple API to provide a high-level
interface to that file format. A programmer can either use
the H5Part API to access the data files or write directly to
the file format using some simple conventions for organizing
and naming the objects stored in the file.
</P>
<P>
In order to store Particle Data in the HDF5 file format,
we have formalized the hierarchical arrangement of the
datasets and naming conventions for the groups and associated
datasets. The sample H5Part API formally encodes
these conventions in order to provide a simple and uniform
way to access these files from C, C++, and Fortran codes.
The API makes it easier to write very portable data adaptors
for visualization tools in order to expand the number of
tools available to access the data. Even so, anyone can use
the HDF5 h5ls utility to examine the organization of the
H5Part files and even write their own HDF5-based interface
for reading and writing the file format. The standards
offered by the sample API are completely independent of
the standard for organizing data within the file.The file
format supports the storage of multiple timesteps
of datasets that contain multiple fields.
