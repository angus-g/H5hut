    <h2>Downloading HDF5</h2></a>
	You will need to download and install the hdf5 library and link H5Part with it.
	<pre>
	ftp ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu
	username: anonymous
	password: your email
	cd HDF/HDF5/current/src
	ls
	get hdf5-1.6.5.tar.gz (get the current version, this as the one on April 20th, 2006)
	cd szip/src
	ls
	get szip-2.0.tar.gz (get the current version, this as the one on April 20th, 2006)
	cd ../../
	cd zlib/1.2/src
	ls
	get zlib-1.2.1.tar.gz (get the current version, this as the one on April 20th, 2006)
	</pre>

 <P>
	Note: you might already have libz in your system and you will not need libsz unless you build hdf5 with support for it.

<h4>Building Parallel HDF5</h4>
<P>
When you build HDF5, you will need to build an version with parallel I/O
enabled. Here is a set of configure options that worked for us on a
Linux workstation running SuSE 10.1 with MPICH installed in /usr/local/mpich.
</p>

<pre>
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5-mpich --enable-parallel CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx --disable-shared --enable-static --enable-stream-vfd
</pre>

<UL>
<li> --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5-mpich : the location where the HDF5 libs and
binaries will be installed.</LI>
<li> --enable-parallel : contrary to the HDF5 documentation, which says that
"--enable-parallel" is optional for building the parallel version of
HDF5, you <b>must</b> have --enable-parallel to get the parallel-enabled
build. See <a href="ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/current/src/unpacked/release_docs/INSTALL_parallel">these notes from HDF5</a> where they claim that
--enable-parallel is optional.</LI>
<li> CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx : contrary to the output from configure --help, the
configure script seems to ignore the CC and CXX environment variables.
We tried setting these environment variables to mpicc and mpicxx,
respectively, and then ran configure with --enable-parallel. The configure
script would faile with this error message: 	
<pre>
checking whether a simple MPI-IO program can be linked... no
configure: error: unable to link a simple MPI-IO application
</pre>
</LI>
<LI> --disable-shared and --enable-static: the HDF5 build failed for us
w/o these options when attempting to read symbols from libmpich.a. The
result of these options is that your parallel-enabled HDF5 libaries
will be static rather than dynamic.
